DBIx::Schema
--------------

This module helps abstract the process of working with complex schemas
of relational SQL database tables. As with DBI, it lets you work with
data a row at a time, but gives you the extra ability to, with a
single method call, reach across and grab rows of related data from
tables located elsewhere in your database, without having to construct
an SQL join clause yourself. The 'distance' from the originating table
to the related one can be arbitrarily long, so long as they are
related in some way -- i.e., could both return data through a single
(though perhaps quite lengthy) SQL query.
