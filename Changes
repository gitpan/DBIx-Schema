Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::Schema.

v0.07 - July 2000 
The module used to choke on databases containing circular relationship
paths; i.e., allowing two or more different ways to relate tables A
and B. It now picks the shortest available path (or picks one of the
shortest and generates a warning if there is a tie). These additional
checks make its schema-crawling a tad slower, adding about a
thousandth of a second of CPU time to a simple statement handle
construction, according to the Benchmark module on my P-266, and more
time if it has lots of circular paths to walk to choose from (at which
point I question your database design philosophy anyway ;-) ), but I
consider this a reasonable cost for fixing this yucky bug.

v0.06 - May 2000
The interface was pathological in some places, and so has been
simplified. The statement handle constructor now takes a 'table' key,
rather than 'fields', which was rather misleading.

The previous version of this module leaked memory like nobody's
business when used in a sustained environment (such as with mod_perl),
due to a big ol' circular reference. This has been quashed.

The documentation was similarly schizophrenic here and there, and has
also seen corrections and clarifications.

The test scripts actually work now, on at least one machine.

Andy Turner (of DBIx::Abstract fame) got his fingers into it, writing
the Datadict module, which speeds up DBIx::Schema quite a bit. It is
included with this distribution.
